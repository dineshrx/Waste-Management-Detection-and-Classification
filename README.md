## Overview

This project utilizes YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, in conjunction with Roboflow to detect and classify waste management items. Waste management is a critical aspect of environmental sustainability, and automating the detection and classification process can greatly enhance efficiency in waste sorting and recycling processes.

## Requirements
The Entire project is worked in the pycharm environment. Before using this project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pycharm
- Roboflow
- Google Colab
- YOLOv8
- Custom Dataset (if you want to train a custom YOLO model)
- GPU (for high quality results)

Required Dependencies such as : 
* ultralytics

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Roboflow, a platform for managing and augmenting image datasets. The dataset comprises images of various waste management items such as plastic bottles, cans, paper, and cardboard. Each image is labeled with bounding boxes and corresponding class labels.

## Model Architecture

We employ YOLOv8, an advanced variant of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. YOLOv8 offers improved accuracy and speed compared to its predecessors, making it suitable for real-time applications.

## Training Process

The training process involves several steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Images are preprocessed and augmented using techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to enhance the diversity of the dataset.
2. **Model Configuration**: YOLOv8 is configured with appropriate hyperparameters and architecture settings.
3. **Training**: The model is trained on the labeled dataset using techniques.
4. **Evaluation**: The trained model's performance is evaluated on a separate validation set to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities.

## Results

After training, the YOLOv8 model demonstrates promising results in detecting and classifying waste management items with high accuracy. The model is capable of identifying various waste materials, facilitating automated waste sorting processes.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the effectiveness of utilizing YOLOv8 and Roboflow for waste management detection and classification. By automating the process, we can streamline waste sorting operations and contribute to environmental conservation efforts.

## Performance
The system has been optimized for real-time performance, particularly when a GPU is used. However, actual performance may vary depending on your system configuration and the task's complexity. To attain the greatest results, consider fine-tuning the system for your individual use case.
